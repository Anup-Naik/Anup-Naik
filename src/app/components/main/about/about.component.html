        applications.

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I started my web development journey during my Information Science
        studies at B.E.C. Bagalkot. What began as coursework soon grew into a
        genuine interest in creating useful web applications. I've been working
        to build my skills in JavaScript technologies, particularly in the
        MEANstack ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h3>My Approach & Tools</h3>
      <p>
        I work with a range of technologies including Angular, TypeScript, and
        responsive CSS for frontend development, alongside Node.js, Express, and
        MongoDB for building backend services. I've also implemented real-time
        features using Socket.IO and developed RESTful APIs for various
        projects. Throughout my work, I strive to write clean, functional code
        that addresses practical needs, focusing on responsive interfaces,
        efficient services, and good security practices. I'm always eager to
        learn new tools and techniques to enhance my development skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Beyond Coding & Connect</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm not working on development projects, I dedicate time to
        expanding my skills through web development courses and tutorials. I've
        completed comprehensive training in both The Web Developer Boot Camp and
        Angular - The Complete Guide on Udemy. I can communicate in English,
        Kannada, and Hindi, which helps me collaborate with diverse teams. I'm
        open to new opportunities and collaborations, so if you have a project
        you'd like to discuss or just want to connect, please feel free to reach
        out!
